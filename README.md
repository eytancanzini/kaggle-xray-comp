# X-Ray Classification using PyTorch and DICOM Image Conversion

## Overview

#### This project is inspired by the [Kaggle Competition] (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/unifesp-x-ray-body-part-classifier/overview) that wants to classify x-ray images based on the imported DICOM image. This project represents a real-world example of where AI can be used to create a meaningful product that reduces the time taken to manually classify an x-ray.

#### The main issue with the dataset is that the images come in DICOM format. DICOM is commonly used in the medical industry but poses issues when used normally. Thankfully somone converted the images into a CSV file and then uploaded the images separately so that solves that problem.
